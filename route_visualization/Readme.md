# Route Visualization

### Purpose:
In order to create meaningful parking data, it is important to know how the parking attendants could patrol the all of the parking locations
in an efficient manner in order to guess when they will be issuing tickets.

### Tools:
Openrouteservice and ortools are used to optimize routes between various parking locations. Then a visualization of these possible
routes is created on a folium map.

### Visualization:
Located [here](https://github.com/Team-Clayton-Cornett/Backend/blob/master/route_visualization/three_route_enforcement.html)
as an HTML file

### Raw Route Output
1. The full raw routes (directions) are output [here](https://github.com/Team-Clayton-Cornett/Backend/tree/master/route_visualization/FullRoutes)
2. The condensed route details (location name and duration between each step) are output [here](https://github.com/Team-Clayton-Cornett/Backend/tree/master/route_visualization/CondensedRoutes)
